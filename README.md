the cvntpad is a (currently wip) 3x3 qmk macropad powered by the waveshare rp2040

it's my first attempt at cad modelling and writing qmk keymaps, so expect it to be very rough around the edges

# the case (wip!)
i made the case using tinkercad, it's very basic and also kinda bad but it's my first cad model so i'm happy with it for now

case `.stl` files are in the `/case` folder, i use cura to print them using the `Fine - (0.1mm)` profile.

# firmware
compiling should be as easy as running `./build.sh`, provided you've installed the [qmk cli](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started?id=set-up-your-environment)

if you need help with other parts of the qmk build process please refer to the [official guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).
